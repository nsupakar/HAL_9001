# ML_101
This serves as a public repo of all the materials I am using to learn ML during the lockdown and beyond.

I will be using Python along with Pandas, Numpy and other libraries.
I would recommend that you use anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/) to save youself from the hassle of downloading and installing Python and required libraries individually.
