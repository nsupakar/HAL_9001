# ML_101
This serves as a public repo of all the materials I am using to learn Machine Learning during the lockdown and beyond.

I am using Python along with Pandas, Numpy and other related libraries for the course. 
I would recommend that you use anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/) to save youself from the hassle of downloading and installing Python and required libraries individually. 

A broad  cirriculum will be posted shortly.
Thank you for visitng. :)
