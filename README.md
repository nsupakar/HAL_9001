# HAL_9001
This serves as a public repo of all the materials I am using to learn Machine Learning during the lockdown and beyond.

I am using Python along with Pandas, Numpy and other related libraries for the course. 
I would recommend that you use anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/) to save youself from the hassle of downloading and installing Python and required libraries individually.

This course builds on a beginer level understanding of Python, if you are just starting out I would strongly suggest this lecture for you  to be up to speed. https://www.quantopian.com/lectures/introduction-to-python

Jupyter notebook is a simple environment that lets you mix text with code. If you have Anaconda installed you can directly start coding on a jupyter notebook by using command promt(start->type CMD->choose command promt->type in jupyter notebook and click enter->Navogate to desired file location->click on new->python 3->Voila,you have an empty notebook-!). Other coding enironments include Spyder which also comes preinstalled with Anacoonda. 

A broad  cirriculum will be posted shortly.
Thank you for visitng. Happy learning :)
